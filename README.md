# CLIMAFIX-Summit-Website

Assignment for Full Stack Intern position.

Many thanks for your interest in the Full Stack Development Internship at EAI.
As part of the evaluation process, we would like you to undertake a small assignment. It is as follows:

We would like you to redesign the home page of one of our web sites CLIMAFIX  ( www.climafix.in ) based on the fact that the CLIMAFIX Summit is the most prominent division of this web site, but the current home page does not carry any information about the summit.

You can check out the following sections of the web site to know more about the summit:

https://www.climafix.in/summit/

https://climafix.in/summit/2023/

https://climafix.in/summit/2024/

https://climafix.in/summit/2025/    

Try redesigning the home page such that it projects the highlights of the CLIMAFIX Summit. And submit the live links with Zip file.
